1. All submitted code must compile under JDK 8. This includes unused code, so don‚Äôt submit extra files that don‚Äôt compile. Any compile errors will result in a 0.

2. Do not include any package declarations in your classes.

3. Do not change any existing class headers, constructors, instance/global variables, or method signatures.

4. Do not add additional public methods.

5. Do not use anything that would trivialize the assignment. (e.g. don‚Äôt import/use java.util.ArrayList for an Array List assignment. Ask if you are unsure.)

6. Always be very conscious of efficiency. Even if your method is to be O(n), traversing the structure multiple times is considered inefficient unless that is absolutely required (and that case is extremely rare).

7. You must submit your source code, the .java files, not the compiled .class files.

8. After you submit your files, redownload them and run them to make sure they are what you intended to submit. You are responsible if you submit the wrong files.

Sorting

For this assignment you will be coding 5 different sorts: insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and LSD radix sort. In addition to the requirements for each sort, to test for efficiency, we will be looking at the number of comparisons made between elements while grading.

Your implementations must match what was taught in lecture and recitation to receive credit. Implementing a different sort or a different implementation for a sort will receive no credit even if it passes comparison checks.

Comparator

Each method (except radix sort) will take in a comparator and use it to compare the elements of the array in various algorithms described below and in the sorting file. You must use this comparator as the number of comparisons performed with it will be used when testing your assignment.

Generic Methods

Most of the assignments for this class so far have utilized generics by incorporating them into the class declaration. However, the rest of the assignments will have you implement various algorithms as static methods in a utility class. Thus, the generics from here on will use generic methods instead of generic classes (hence the &lt;T&gt; in each of the method headers and javadocs).

Inplace Sorts

Some of the sorts below are inplace sorts. This means that the items in the array passed in aren‚Äôt copied over to another data structure. Note that you can still create variables that hold only one item; you cannot create another data structure such as array or list in the method.

Stable Sorts

Some of the sorts below are stable sorts. This means that duplicates should remain in the same relative positions after sorting as they were before sorting.

Insertion Sort

Insertion sort should be inplace and stable. It should have a worst case running time of O(n2) and a best case running time of O(n).

Note that, for this implementation, you should sort from the beginning of the array. This means that after the first pass, indices 0 and 1 should be relatively sorted. After the second pass, indices 0-2 should be relatively sorted. After the third pass, indices 0-3 should be relatively sorted, and so on.

Selection Sort

Selection sort should be inplace and unstable. It should have a worst case running time of O(n2) and a best case running time of O(n2). You can implement either the minimum version or the maximum version; both are acceptable since they will both yield the same number of comparisons.

Merge Sort

Merge sort should be out of place and stable. It should have a worst case running time of O(nlogn) and a best case running time of O(nlogn).

LSD Radix Sort

LSD Radix sort should be out of place and stable. It should have a worst case running time of O(kn) and a best case running time of O(kn), where k is the number of digits in the longest number. You will be implementing the least significant digit version of the sort. You will be sorting ints. Note that you CANNOT change the ints into Strings at any point in the sort for this exercise. The sort must be done in base 10. Also, as per the forbidden statements section, you cannot use anything from the Math class besides Math.abs(). However, be wary of handling overflow if you use Math.abs()!

Quick Sort

Quick sort should be inplace and unstable. It should have a worst case running time of O(n2) and a best case running time of O(nlogn). Your implementation must be randomized as specified in the method‚Äôs interface.

Grading

Here is the grading breakdown for the assignment. There are various deductions not listed that are incurred when breaking the rules listed in this PDF, and in other various circumstances.

Methods:

insertionSort 12pts

selectionSort 12pts

mergeSort 17pts

quickSort 17pts

lsdRadixSort 17pts

Other:

Checkstyle 10pts

Efficiency 15pts

Total: 100pts

A note on JUnits

If you need help on running JUnits, there is a guide, available on Canvas under Files, to help you run JUnits on the command line or in IntelliJ.

Style and Formatting

It is important that your code is not only functional but is also written clearly and with good style. We will be checking your code against a style checker that we are providing. It is located on Canvas, under Files, along with instructions on how to use it. We will take off a point for every style error that occurs. If you feel like what you wrote is in accordance with good style but still sets off the style checker please email Tim Aveni (tja@gatech.edu) with the subject header of ‚Äú[CS 1332] CheckStyle XML‚Äù.

Javadocs

Vulgar/Obscene Language

Any submission that contains profanity, vulgar, or obscene language will receive an automatic zero on the assignment. This policy applies not only to comments/javadocs but also things like variable names.

Exceptions

When throwing exceptions, you must include a message by passing in a String as a parameter. The message must be useful and tell the user what went wrong. ‚ÄúError‚Äù, ‚ÄúBAD THING HAPPENED‚Äù, and ‚Äúfail‚Äù are not good messages. The name of the exception itself is not a good message.

For example:

Bad: throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException(‚ÄúIndex is out of bounds.‚Äù);

Good: throw new IllegalArgumentException(‚ÄúCannot insert null data into data structure.‚Äù);

Generics

If available, use the generic type of the class; do not use the raw type of the class. For example, use new LinkedNode&lt;Integer&gt;() instead of new LinkedNode(). Using the raw type of the class will result in a penalty.

Forbidden Statements

‚Ä¢ package

‚Ä¢ System.arraycopy()

‚Ä¢ clone()

‚Ä¢ assert()

‚Ä¢ Arrays class

‚Ä¢ Array class

‚Ä¢ Thread class

‚Ä¢ Collections class

‚Ä¢ Collection.toArray()

‚Ä¢ Reflection APIs

‚Ä¢ Inner or nested classes

‚Ä¢ Lambda Expressions

‚Ä¢ Method References (using the :: operator to obtain a reference to a method)

‚Ä¢ Anything besides Math.abs() in the Math class (for this homework only)

‚Ä¢ String class (for this homework only)

If you‚Äôre not sure on whether you can use something, and it‚Äôs not mentioned here or anywhere else in the homework files, just ask.

Debug print statements are fine, but nothing should be printed when we run your code. We expect clean runs ‚Äì printing to the console when we‚Äôre grading will result in a penalty. If you submit these, we will take off points.

Provided

The following file(s) have been provided to you. There are several, but we‚Äôve noted the ones to edit.

1. Sorting.java

This is the class in which you will implement the different sorting algorithms. Feel free to add private static helper methods but do not add any new public methods, new classes, instance variables, or static variables.

2. SortingStudentTests.java

This is the test class that contains a set of tests covering the basic operations on the Sorting class. It is not intended to be exhaustive and does not guarantee any type of grade. Write your own tests to ensure you cover all edge cases.

Deliverables

You must submit all of the following file(s). Please make sure the filename matches the filename(s) below, and that only the following file(s) are present. If you make resubmit, make sure only one copy of the file is present in the submission.

After submitting, double check to make sure it has been submitted on Canvas and then download your uploaded files to a new folder, copy over the support files, recompile, and run. It is your responsibility to re-test your submission and discover editing oddities, upload issues, etc.
